/**
 * @brief QWidgetAction that allows to use DolphinUrlNavigators in a toolbar.
 *
 * This class is mainly a container that manages up to two DolphinUrlNavigator objects so they
 * can be added to a toolbar. It also deals with alignment.
 *
 * The structure of the defaultWidget() of this QWidgetAction is as follows:
 * - A QSplitter manages up to two sides which each correspond to one DolphinViewContainer.
 *      The secondary side only exists for split view and is created by
 *      createSecondaryUrlNavigator() when necessary.
 * - Each side is a QWidget which I call NavigatorWidget with a QHBoxLayout.
 * - Each NavigatorWidget consists an UrlNavigator, an emptyTrashButton, a
 *   networkFolderButton, and spacing.
 * - Only the primary navigatorWidget has leading spacing. Both have trailing spacing.
 *      The spacing is there to align the UrlNavigator with its DolphinViewContainer.
